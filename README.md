web-cloudname-availability-widget
=================================

A piece of Javascript code that checks if the value of a named field is a valid and available cloud name. 

You can view the test directly from github by using this url:

  http://rawgit.com/RespectNetwork/web-cloudname-availability-widget/master/test/availabilitytest.html

In the availabilitytest.html file the availibilityAPI property is currently set to 

   http://cloudnameavailability.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/availability/equals/
   
Which is the TEST Registry service as documented here:

  http://docs.respectnetwork.net/wiki/CloudName_CheckAvailability_Service
  
The production endpoint will be forthcoming soon.
